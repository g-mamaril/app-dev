<em>Peaky Blinders</em>

<strong>The Characters consisted of star studded actors such as:</strong>
---
- <strong>Cillian Murphy</strong> as Thomas 'Tommy' Shelby
- <strong>Helen McCrory</strong> as Polly 'Aunt Pol' Gray
- <strong>Tom Hardy</strong> as Alfie Solomons

These are just the few actors that are in the series, their genre is what captured me the most as it is *'Period Crime Drama'* and the way the storyline flows. I haven't finished the series but I got a bit bored since * *Spoiler Alert* * when tragedy struck on Grace (Thomas Shelby's former wife), got shot and died in Tommy's Arms :sob: as I've watched that happen, I really got sad because before they even fell for each other, I already saw the spark between them. Then, another climax of the series was when Tommy almost got shot and buried in a nondescipt field. But then again, He wasn't killed. Steven Knight, the scriptwriter stated that they killed Grace as to stay with the storyline that, Tommy shouldn't be happy. Even though they stood with that storyline. I am not going to make complaints because it carries the whole series.
